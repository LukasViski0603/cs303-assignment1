## Description
This C++ program manages an array of integers and allows users to perform various operations such as finding, modifying, adding, and removing values. It'll initially read data from a file and then provide a menu interface for the user. 

## How to Compile and Run
1. Ensure a C++ compiler such as Visual Studios is installed. 
2. In the compiler, click open file. Simply open .sln file in root file. (functions.cpp, main.cpp, and functions.h should all be in this same location)
3. Click 'Run', which in Visual Studios 2022 is a green play button at the top. A terminal should open, displaying the menu of the program. There, a single designated letter (capitalized or not, it does not matter) will perform the desired actions. 

## Input File
The program reads data from a file named "A1input.txt". If the array is empty or unusual, ensure this file is in the same directory as the executable. Each line of the file should contain A SINGLE INTEGER. 

## Limitations
- The maximum size of the array is set to 100 integers.
- The program assumes valid integer inputs from the user.
